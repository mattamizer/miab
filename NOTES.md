This was a pretty fun exercise overall! I enjoyed working on it and I think I got most of the edge cases covered.

It's probably worth noting that this is the first time I've written a Flask app so apologies as I'm sure things could be more idiomatic.

Things I wish I'd gotten to or had time to do better:

1. Made this more idiomatically Flask
2. Had more time to write proper API tests with `mock` and the like
3. I got a good reminder to read the docs carefully. I wasted a lot of time using `set` instead of `add` to put data in the cache.
